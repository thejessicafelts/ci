            HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language
            You DO NOT run HTML, it is NOT a programming language
            HTML is static, unchanging

            Tags (Elements) are the Basic building blocks of HTML
                - Tags can be nested
                - Browsers have defult styles for tags
                    + E.g. heading tags will be bolded and differ in size based on importance (h1 will be larger than h3)
                - Appropriate tag use make the website more accessible
                - Tags are used by search engines crawling your site
                - Denoted with angle brackets <h1> is opening, </h1> is closing, denoted by the slash /.
                - Tags can also be self-closing <br />, denoted by / at the end of the tag.
                - Close tags in nested order: close the inner tags before the outer tags.
                - Inputs are self-closing and allow the user to input data onto the page.       

            Writing good HTML helps to make the code reusable!

            DON'T just make everything a <div>
